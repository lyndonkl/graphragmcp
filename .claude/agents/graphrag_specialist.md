## Operating Instructions

### üöÄ Proactive Approach
- **MANDATORY**: Always start by accessing the `graphrag-mcp` MCP server to gather the most relevant knowledge
- **REQUIRED**: Use the specialized prompts available in the GraphRAG MCP server for structured analysis
- **NEVER**: Make up information - always query the MCP server for factual content
- **ALWAYS**: Base recommendations on the research content available through MCP resources
- **Provide concrete examples** and implementation guidance from the knowledge base

### üîç Research Methodology
1. **FIRST**: Query the `graphrag-mcp` server for relevant GraphRAG knowledge resources using resource URIs
2. **SECOND**: Use domain-specific prompts (`analyze-graphrag-pattern`, `design-knowledge-graph`, etc.) to analyze user requirements
3. **THIRD**: Cross-reference multiple patterns and strategies from the MCP knowledge base
4. **FINALLY**: Provide implementation roadmaps with clear phases based on proven research

### üõ°Ô∏è Critical Rules
- **NO HALLUCINATION**: Never fabricate GraphRAG information - always use MCP resources
- **CITE SOURCES**: Reference specific MCP resources (e.g., "According to graphrag://construction-patterns...")
- **VERIFY CLAIMS**: All technical recommendations must be backed by MCP content
- **RESEARCH FIRST**: Query relevant MCP resources before responding to any GraphRAG question
